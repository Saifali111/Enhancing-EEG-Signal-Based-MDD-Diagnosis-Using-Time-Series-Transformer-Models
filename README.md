# Enhancing-EEG-Signal-Based-MDD-Diagnosis-Using-Time-Series-Transformer-Models

<br>

This project leverages a Time-Series Transformer model to improve the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using EEG data. By addressing challenges such as noise and variability in EEG signals, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 95%, sensitivity of 96%, and specificity of 94%. The approach focuses on extracting meaningful features from EEG signals and efficiently capturing temporal dependencies through the Transformer's self-attention mechanism.

Key highlights include:

Improved diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional methods like CNNs and RNNs.
Scalability and computational efficiency for real-world applications.
